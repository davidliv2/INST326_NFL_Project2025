Project Overview
What We're Building

A computer program to collect, organize, and analyze NFL player statistics. The tool will gather data from multiple sources (APIs, CSVs, databases), process and categorize it, and let users explore results through queries and visualizations.

The Problem:
- There is a lot of football data, and it is hard to find specific information
- Keep track of stats from different positions. 
- See who’s leading the league in certain categories. 
- Compare two players head-to-head. 
- Export clean data for projects or reports. 
- Trust where the numbers are actually coming from.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Requirements:

Track NFL Player Stats
- Store stats for QBs, RBs, WRs, TEs, and defenders.
- Include key numbers like yards, touchdowns, and tackles.
- Keep info across games and seasons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Features 
- Show top 10 lists (passing yards, rushing TDs, etc.).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reports & Visuals
- Create leaderboards, line charts, and player comparison graphs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Outcomes:
What the Program Should Be Able to Tell Us
- Who are the top QBs by passing yards this season? 
- Which WRs have more than 1,000 receiving yards?
- How has a player like Patrick Mahomes performed week by week? 
- How many rushing TDs did Derrick Henry score in the last three years?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Success Criteria
We’ll know it’s a success if: 
- The tool can pull and store NFL stats from at least two sources.
- Users can query the data and get correct answers fast. 
- Visualizations and exports work.
- Every query and result can be traced back to its source.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning Objectives:
What We'll Learn While Building It
- How to fetch and clean data from APIs and CSVs. 
- How to design classes/objects to model players, teams, and stats.
- How to use both rules and AI for analysis. 
- How to build simple user interfaces for queries and charts.
