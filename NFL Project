# ===========================
# 1. Validation / Simple Helpers
# ===========================
# Small helper functions for cleaning and checking data:
# - Validate team names (like "KC" or "BAL")
# - Validate player positions (like "QB" or "RB")
# - Clean and normalize player names

# 2. Data Loading, Merging, and Canonicalization
# ==========================================
# Functions that handle loading and preparing data:
# - Load CSV or API data
# - Merge different tables (like weekly stats + player info)
# - Rename and organize columns for consistency


# =========================
# 3. Calculations and Analysis
# =========================
# Main football analytics section:
# - Calculate QB ratings and player efficiency

# - Predict or estimate future stats (optional)


# ========================
# 4. Visualization and Export
# ========================

# - Plot leaderboards or player comparisons using bar charts
# - Export results to CSV files for reporting


# =================
# 5. Demo / Quick Test
